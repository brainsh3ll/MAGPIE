# MAGPIE: Monitoring AGainst cyberPhysIcal thrEats

### This README is in draft ###

MAGPIE is modular framework for real-time cyber-physical intrusion detection systems (IDS). The MAGIE concept consists of a high-level architecture that specifies a number of distinct components which form various roles within the IDS, which can be developed independently and scaled accordingly to the operating environment.

A MAGPIE prototype implementation is also provided which represents a small scale cyber-physical IDS.
