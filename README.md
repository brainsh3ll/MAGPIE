# MAGPIE: Monitoring AGainst cyberPhysIcal thrEats
A framework for cyber-physical intrusion detection systems

### This README is in draft ###

MAGPIE is modular framework for developing real-time cyber-physical intrusion detections. The MAGIE concept consists of a high-level architecture that specifies a number of distinct components which form various roles within the IDS, which can be developed independently and scaled accordingly to the operating environment.

A MAGPIE prototype implementation is also provided which represents a small scale cyber-physical IDS.
